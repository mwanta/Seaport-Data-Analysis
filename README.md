# Seaport-Data-Analysis
A data analysis project completed in Apache Superset using the SQL Lab and graphing features.

The graphs were created by merging data sets together through the SQL Lab, as well as making appropriate alterations
to the data sets to allow for better analysis.

The results of these graphs were used to implement strategies to increase visitor attendance at the museum. 

Pictures of some of the graphs:
